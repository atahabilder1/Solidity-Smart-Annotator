# Solidity Smart Annotator (SSA) - Complete Project Guide

## üîπ Project Overview

The **Solidity Smart Annotator (SSA)** is a tool designed to analyze and annotate Solidity smart contracts. The system consists of a **FastAPI backend** that processes Solidity files uploaded via a **React.js frontend**. The backend uses **Slither**, an open-source static analysis tool, to extract insights about the contract structure, including functions, variables, and security vulnerabilities. The frontend provides an intuitive interface where users can upload Solidity files or submit GitHub repository links for analysis.

## üîπ Underlying Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Libraries**: Axios (for API calls), Styled Components (for UI improvements)

#### Functionality:
- File upload for Solidity smart contracts
- Input field for GitHub repository link submission
- Displays analyzed contract details in a user-friendly format

### Backend:
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Libraries**: Slither, Solidity Parser, PyGitHub, OpenAI (for future AI-based annotations)

#### Functionality:
- Accepts Solidity files and GitHub repository links for analysis
- Processes Solidity files using **Slither** to extract contract structure and vulnerabilities
- Returns an **annotated Solidity file** and produces a **separate project summary** from the given smart contract file.

## üîπ Features & Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Solidity File & GitHub URL Input
- Users can either:
  - Upload a Solidity file directly.
  - Enter a GitHub repository URL to fetch Solidity files.
- The frontend sends the file or URL to the backend for processing.

### 2. File Handling & Preprocessing
- The backend:
  - Saves uploaded files in an **uploads/** directory.
  - For GitHub repositories, fetches Solidity files using **PyGitHub**.

### 3. AI-Powered Code Annotation
- **OpenAI models** will analyze Solidity files and generate line-by-line explanations.
- **Annotated Solidity code** will be returned in the response.
- A **separate project summary** will be generated based on the analyzed contract.

### 4. Static Analysis with Slither
- The backend runs **Slither**, which extracts:
  - Contract functions and modifiers.
  - State variables and their visibility.
  - Security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
- **Slither** returns structured contract insights.

### 5. Displaying Results on the Frontend
- The frontend parses the backend response and displays:
  - **Contract structure** (functions, variables, access modifiers).
  - **Security insights** detected by **Slither**.
  - **AI-generated annotations**.
  - **Generated project summary.**

### 6. Future Improvements
- Integration with AI-based security scanners.
- Downloadable annotated Solidity files.
- Visual representation of contract structure.
